1. Delete "main.o" and "my_first_hps-fpga" files from the "c_code_all" directory (IMPORTANT!)

2. Navigate to "C:\intelFPGA\17.0\embedded" and run "Embedded_Command_Shell.bat"
   Note: Installed via "SoCEDSSetup-20.1.0.711-windows.exe"

3. Within shell, navigate to the "c_code_all" directory with "cd" commands
   Note: Header files for you C code can be generated by navigating to your
         Quartus project folder and executing the "./embedded_command_shell.sh" command.
         "hps_0.h" file should be generated.
	     "generate_hps_qsys_header.sh" should be present in your Quartus project folder!
         These steps are necessary only if you modify Qsys!
   
4. Enter "make" and press enter

5. Rename the generated "my_first_hps-fpga" file and copy it to usb drive for delivery.
   Note: "final_test" is a renamed "my_first_hps-fpga" file!
