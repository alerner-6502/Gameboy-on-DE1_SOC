How to transfer files from USB to boot SD card:

01. Inset boot SD card into your DE1-SoC
02. Make sure BOOTSEL[4:0] switches on your FPGA are set to 5'b01101
03. Turn on your FPGA
04. Connect micro usb cable to the UART_TO_USB port on your FPGA.
05. Connect the other end of the micro usb cable to your computer
06. Run PuTTY.exe
07. Select "Session" in the category tree.
07. Select "serial" as the connection type and enter "COM7" as the serial line and "115200" for speed
07. Enter "DE1-SoC" into the "Save Session" window and press "Save". A new "DE1-SoC" entry should appear next to "Default Settings"
07. Double click on the "DE1-SoC" entry to start communicating. A linux terminal should open up.
08. Press ENTER

09. Enter "root" (password) and press ENTER
10. Check the directory with "-ls -la"
11. Create a new directory with "mkdir". For example "mkdir my_usb_mount_directory"
12. Insert your USB drive into the USB slot on your FPGA board
13. Log text should appear in the terminal, press ENTER
14. Type "lsusb" and press ENTER. Verify that your USB device has been found
    Example:
	
	root@socfpga:~# lsusb
	Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:2512 Standard Microsystems Corp. USB 2.0 Hub
	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
	Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0930:6545 Toshiba Corp. Kingston DataTraveler 102 Flash Drive / HEMA Flash Drive 2 GB / PNY Attache 4GB Stick   <--- My USB drive
	
15. Type "lsblk" and press ENTER. Varius that your USB device has a dedicated partition.
    Example:
	
	root@socfpga:~# lsblk
	NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
	sda           8:0    1 955.5M  0 disk
	`-sda1        8:1    1 954.5M  0 part                       <--- My USB drive partition (not mounted yet)
	mmcblk0     179:0    0   3.7G  0 disk
	|-mmcblk0p1 179:1    0 819.2M  0 part
	|-mmcblk0p2 179:2    0     1G  0 part /
	`-mmcblk0p3 179:3    0     1M  0 part
	
16. Mount your USB drive partition to your folder: Type "mount /dev/sda1 my_usb_mount_directory" and press ENTER
17. Navigate to your folder: "cd my_usb_mount_directory"
18. Type "ls -la" and press ENTER to verify USB drive contents

19. Use "pwm" command to get your current directory name
20. Use "cd ~" to navigate to your home directory. It's not the top directory!
21. To copy a file use the "cp" command. For example: "cp /home/root/my_usb_mount_directory/miku.txt /home/root/miku_copy.txt"
22. To copy a directoy use "cp -R" command. For example: "cp -R /home/root/my_usb_mount_directory/Lecture37 /home/root/Lecture37_copy"
23. To view text files use "cat". For example: "cat miku_copy.txt"

24. To unmount your USB drive from the folder, use the "umount" command. Example: "umount my_usb_mount_directory" command
