
1. Ensure that the MSEL switches on the DE1-SoC have been configured to MSEL[4:0] = 5'b01010.
   Note: Don't get tricked by the "ON" label on the switch! It's actually the other way around!
         Your switch should look like this: (MSEL[4:0] = 5'b01010)
		 
		 0
		   +-------------+         MSEL[4:0] = 5'b10010  // FPGA configured from EPCS
		   | *   *   * * |         MSEL[4:0] = 5'b01010  // FPGA configured from HPS software: Linux
		   |   *   *     |
		   +-------------+
		 1   0 1 2 3 4 5
		       MSEL

2. Convert your SOF file to RBF file. To do this, use a tool within quartus "File->Convert Programming Files...".
   a) Select "Raw Binary File (.rbf)" as your programming file type.
   b) Select "Passive Parallel x16" as your mode
   c) Specify the destination file name in the File name field.
   d) Click and highlight SOF Data then add the .SOF file that you wish to convert by clicking Add File....
   e) Click and highlight the newly added .SOF file in the list, then select Properties. You should see a new window pop up.
      Enable file compression by ticking the checkbox, then press OK.
   f) Click Generate to generate the .RBF file. 
   
3. Transfer your .RBF file to your linux boot up SD card (via USB drive for example)

4. Navigate to "/etc/init.d/" and create a "programfpga" text file with VI.

5. Edit "programfpga" file by entering the following content:
   Note: use VI's documentation to help you out.

	echo 0 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/fpga2hps/enable
	echo 0 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/hps2fpga/enable
	echo 0 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/lwhps2fpga/enable
	dd if=/home/root/soc_system.rbf of=/dev/fpga0 bs=1M    <--- provide full path to your .RBF file!!!
	echo 1 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/fpga2hps/enable
	echo 1 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/hps2fpga/enable
	echo 1 > /sys/class/fpga-bridge/lwhps2fpga/enable
	sh -c /home/root/usb_joystick                          <--- optional: provide full path to your linux executable (if you want it to start at boot up)

6. Save file and quit.

7. Grant "programfpga" file execution permission by executing the "chmod u+rwx programfpga" command

8. You may check your script by executing it with the "/etc/init.d/programfpga start" command.

9. Add your file to the startup list by executing the "update-rc.d programfpga defaults" command

10. Reboot your DE1-SoC board.
